				<h2>Professional Summary</h2>

				<p>Technical Marketing student at Startup Institute Chicago with experience in healthcare, social media and website management. Particularly interested in leveraging data analytics to drive growth and value in startup companies. Always interested in non-profit organizations and companies with a mission to improve the lives of others.</p>

				<p>My experience working in an inner-city health clinic, as well as a not-for-profit providing support to Bangladesh’s rural poor, has opened my eyes to the profound quality-of-life disparities created by lack of access to the most basic resources: food, water, clean air, health care, etc. Plainly put, global distribution of financial wealth has created gaping inequities, rewarding a small percentage of the world’s population with the comfort of security while condemning billions to an impoverished existence. However, I believe that technology, with its increasingly innovative and widespread applications, holds vast potential for addressing these issues in a meaningful and enduring way. Today, I seek to expand my understanding and use of marketing and technology so that tomorrow, I can leverage available resources and employ emerging technologies to generate solutions for creatively addressing global inequities.</p>
