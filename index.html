				<p>My experience working in an inner-city health clinic, as well as a not-for-profit providing support to Bangladesh’s rural poor, has opened my eyes to the profound quality-of-life disparities created by lack of access to the most basic resources: food, water, clean air, health care, etc. Plainly put, global distribution of financial wealth has created gaping inequities, rewarding a small percentage of the world’s population with the comfort of security while condemning billions to an impoverished existence. However, I believe that technology, with its increasingly innovative and widespread applications, holds vast potential for addressing these issues in a meaningful and enduring way. Today, I seek to expand my understanding and use of marketing and technology so that tomorrow, I can leverage available resources and employ emerging technologies to generate solutions for creatively addressing global inequities.</p>
